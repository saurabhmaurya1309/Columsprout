# Frontend Assignment: Dynamic Table with Dropdown Selection

## 1. Assignment Overview

### Objective  
Build a **React application** that displays data in a table, allowing users to switch between different data sources using a dropdown menu. The goal is to create a simple yet polished user experience with a focus on clean design and usability.

### Note  

We value **attention to detail, clean design, and thoughtful execution**. The code doesn’t need to be production-ready but should reflect quality.  
Feel free to exceed requirements and update the README with any bonus features or improvement ideas.

## 4. Backend API

The application will fetch data from the following endpoints:

- **Posts**:  
  [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)  
  Columns to display: **ID**, **Title**

- **Comments**:  
  [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments)  
  Columns to display: **ID**, **Name**

API calls should dynamically update the table content based on the dropdown selection.
